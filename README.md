# MineMaps
RGB LED light puzzle game ported from an Arduino project using godot 3.4 game engine.
The light will change colors to indicate level of safety on the 2d map, use the arrow keys to move around the map.
This is my first project released with godot so there may be a few issues. You can  comment on them at the itch.io page, and try the online version.
