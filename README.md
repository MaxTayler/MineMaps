# MineMaps
RGB LED light puzzle game ported from an Arduino project using godot 3.4 game engine.
The RGB Light will change colors to indicate level of safety on the 2 map, use the arrow keys to move around the map.
This is my first project released with godot so there may be a few issues. You can  comment on them at the itch.io page, and try the online version.
